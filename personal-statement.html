            Dr. Baehr,

            I decided I would go with a space theme for this assignment. Though
            not realized in any of my other work, I do enjoy science and space
            themes and I decided that would be my creative project.

            I won't explain why I have a space suit, but I knew from the get-go
            that I needed to have a photo of myself in the spacesuit somehow.

            In retrospect, the falling motion might be too distracting,
            but I couldn't resist.

            Enjoy.

            - Kenyan
